# Investigating the relationship between fuel price disparities and traffic flow on border roads: A regression analysis approach

This project aims to investigate the potential correlation between fuel price differentials in neighboring countries and traffic flow on rural roads along border regions. Despite the absence of direct data on fuel smuggling rates, our study hypothesizes a meaningful connection between fuel price discrepancies and fuel smuggling activity, as reflected _probably_ in traffic flow patterns along border roads. To ascertain the feasibility and validity of our proposed methodology, we present preliminary arguments and analyses that underscore the viability of our approach and the acceptability of our hypotheses within the context of the research topic.

Understanding the correlation between fuel price differentials and fuel smuggling is crucial for addressing socio-economic, security, and environmental challenges. By detecting and disrupting smuggling networks, policymakers can enhance border security and safeguard national interests. Additionally, addressing the root causes of fuel smuggling promotes fair competition, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. Ultimately, evidence-based policies informed by our research can foster socio-economic development and stability in affected areas.
